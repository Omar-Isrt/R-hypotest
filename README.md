## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Râ€‘HypoTest** is an R package (or script) that provides a single, unified function for performing a variety of hypothesis testsâ€”both parametric and nonâ€‘parametric. It computes test statistics, _p_-values, and confidence intervals, helping you draw statistical conclusions from your sample data with ease.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Parametric tests**  
  - Oneâ€‘sample Z and T tests  
  - Twoâ€‘sample (independent and paired) T tests  
  - Oneâ€‘way ANOVA (more than two means)  
  - Pearsonâ€™s Chiâ€‘Square test  

- **Nonâ€‘parametric tests**  
  - Bootstrap hypothesis test  

- **Robust output**  
  - Test statistic  
  - _p_-value  
  - Confidence interval  
  - Degrees of freedom (where applicable)  

- **Flexible input**  
  - Supports vectors, matrices, factors  
  - Specify population standard deviations or estimate from data  
  - Adjustable significance level (_Î±_) and bootstrap replicates

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<yourâ€‘username>/Râ€‘HypoTest.git
   cd Râ€‘HypoTest
   ```

2. **Source the script**  
   ```r
   source("test_of_hypothesis.R")
   ```

> _If you package it as an R package, you could also use_  
> ```r
> devtools::install_local("path/to/R-HypoTest")
> ```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

Load the function into your R session:

```r
source("test_of_hypothesis.R")

# Example: oneâ€‘sample Zâ€‘test
x      <- rnorm(50, mean = 3.5, sd = 1.7)
sigma  <- 1        # known population sd
mu_0   <- 3        # hypothesized mean
alpha  <- 0.05     # significance level
H1     <- "mu>mu_0"

result <- test_of_hypothesis(
  approach  = "parametric",
  x         = x,
  sigma_x   = sigma,
  mu_0      = mu_0,
  alpha     = alpha,
  H1        = H1
)

print(result)
```

## ðŸ§ª Examples

### Oneâ€‘Sample Tâ€‘Test

```r
x     <- rnorm(20, mean = 5, sd = 2)
mu_0  <- 4.5
alpha <- 0.05
H1    <- "mu<mu_0"

```r
pre  <- rnorm(30, mean = 100, sd = 15)
post <- pre + rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 10)

test_of_hypothesis(
  approach     = "parametric",
  independent  = FALSE,
  x            = pre,
  y            = post,
  alpha        = 0.01,
  H1           = "mu>mu_0"
)
```

### Oneâ€‘Way ANOVA

scores <- c(22, 42, 44, 52, 45, 37, 52, 33, 8, 47, 43, 32, 16, 24, 19, 18, 34, 39)
group  <- rep(c("A","B","C"), each = 6)

test_of_hypothesis(
  approach = "parametric",
  x        = group,
  y        = scores,
  n1       = 3,
  n2       = 6,
  alpha    = 0.05,
  H1       = "means differ"
)
```

```r
x <- rnorm(12, 10, 1)
y <- rnorm(1000, 20, 5)

test_of_hypothesis(
  approach = "non_parametric",
  x        = x,
  y        = y,
  B        = 1000,
  alpha    = 0.05,
